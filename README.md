## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Space Tourism](https://spacetourist.netlify.app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - React library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I decided to develop this page using React since I usually feel more comfortable with Vue.js. Also, I took this opportunity to practice tailwind for styles

### Continued development

The crew members images would have a better user experience using a carousel, so i might implement this later.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - Usually i do all styles using only CSS or SASS, so the framework documentation was essential for me.
